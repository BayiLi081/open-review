(30s) Good morning, thanks for coming to my go and no go presentation here and online. So today I will present my current progress and the plan for the next three years. The supervision team includes Professor Maarten, Tatiana, and Clémentine. The topic of my research is agent-based modelling of urban economic segregation in the Netherlands. 

---

<!-- Slide 02: Define the targeted social phenomenon -->

## What is Urban Economic Segregation?

The uneven distribution of groups with **different economic status** across **residential neighbourhoods** of a city or an urban region (adapted from Van Ham et al. (2021)).

<div class="summary-footer">A complex and multi-faceted issue of Urban Economic Segregation</div>
<div class="probar-footer">
  <div class="bar-light-grey">
    <div class="bar-grey" style="width:3%"></div>
  </div>
</div>

???

(50s) To study urban economic segregation, we fist need to define the term first. We see urban economic segregation as the uneven distribution of groups with different economic status across residential neighbourhoods of a city or an urban region.

--

## Multi-faceted issue of Urban Economic Segregation

- Residential

  Why do people choose to live where they live?

- Economic

  What drove the people's economic status change over time?

???

(1m'10s) Therefore, the phenomenon can basically interpreted as two facets: residential and economic. So two related fundamental questions are: 1. Why do people choose to live where they live? 2. How the their economic status change over time?

--

## Complexity of Urban Economic Segregation

A complex interplay of family, housing, financial and labour market factors, influenced by local circumstances.

???

(1m'30s) Regarding the two question and the complex theory, urban economic segregation can be described by interconnected networks of households, being effected by a complex interplay of family, housing, financial and labour market factors, and influenced by local circumstances.

---

<!-- Slide 03: Introduce of agent-based approach -->

## Generative Method

> Epstein (2006): If you didn't grow it, you didn't explain it emergence.

A computational simulation that emerges the pattern of economic segregation based on the designated mechanisms and their interplay.

<div class="summary-footer">ABM, a prominent generative approach, provides a powerful framework for studying complex systems</div>
<div class="probar-footer">
  <div class="bar-light-grey">
    <div class="bar-grey" style="width:10%"></div>
  </div>
</div>

???

(1m'50s) Generative approach is used to understand and explain urban economic segregation in this complexity. In this sense, the target is to grow the pattern of urban economic segregation in a computational simulation from designated framework.

--

.right[.image-70[![](../imgs/whatisABM/whatisABM_outcomes.svg)]]

## Agent-Based Modelling

It generates the urban economic segregation through **autonomous residential and economic decisions, and local interactions of heterogeneous agents**. 

> A method to address complex social phenomena by searching for **causal mechanisms** that exhibit generative power  of target social phenomena (Epstein 2006, Hedström 2005).

???

(2m'10s) Specifically, we are using agent-based modelling to describe complex behaviours as a generative process from bottom up to the collective segregation pattern.
ABMs are a bottom-up approach of generative modelling where **heterogenous entities** make autonomous decisions of actions, based on their evolution and that of other entities.

It is capable of searching for causal mechanism that exhibit generative power of urban economic segregation.

<!-- Slide 04: The overview of the ABM's theoretical framework -->

# Overview

## Overarching Research Question

**How can agent-based modelling help us understand the crucial mechanisms which drove urban economic segregation happened in the Netherlands?**

<div class="summary-footer">Aim is to identify the crucial mechanisms and to capture the complex interplay by ABM</div>
<div class="probar-footer">
  <div class="bar-light-grey">
    <div class="bar-grey" style="width:15%"></div>
  </div>
</div>

???

The overall research question to ask in the project, therefore, is formulated as how can agent-based modelling help us understand the crucial mechanisms which drove urban economic segregation happened in the Netherlands?

--

## Overall Research Aim

**Build an agent-based model, involving the main mechanisms of urban economic segregation and their interplays, to simulate the evolution of residential pattern in the Dutch cities.**

???

Hence, the aim is to build an agent-based model, involving the main mechanisms of urban economic segregation and their interplays, to simulate the evolution of residential pattern in the Dutch cities.

<!-- Slide 05: Sub aims and outcomes (1-2) -->

# Overview

## Sub aims and outcomes

**Aim 1**: Investigate the current knowledge basis of constructing an agent-based model of segregation and their theoretical basis

**Paper 1**: Review of mechanisms and process design in agent-based models of urban economic segregation

<div class="summary-footer"> Understanding and a test on single city to start the model.</div>
<div class="probar-footer">
  <div class="bar-light-grey">
    <div class="bar-grey" style="width:20%"></div>
  </div>
</div>

???

Four sub amis was further divided to address different aspects.

The first one is to investigate the current knowledge basis of constructing an agent-based model of segregation and their theoretical basis. It corresponds to the paper 1, which is a integrated review of theoretical works and agent-based models of segregation.

--

<br>

**Aim 2**: Develop an ABM to explain the segregation landscape in Groningen, the Netherlands during 2011-2023

**Paper 2**: Simulating the evolution of urban economic segregation pattern using agent-based modelling: case study of Groningen, the Netherlands

???

In the second one, we will select one city as an example to build our single-city model to deliver a local test of the model in city of Groningen. 

---

<!-- Slide 05: Sub aims and outcomes (3-4) -->

# Overview

## Sub aims and outcomes

**Aim 3**: Develop a national scale ABM to explain the segregation pattern at multi-level scale in the Netherlands during 2011-2023

**Paper 3**: A national scale simulation on urban
economic segregation in the Netherlands

<div class="summary-footer"> Upscale to a national model and vary the scenarios to evaluate policy strategies.</div>
<div class="probar-footer">
  <div class="bar-light-grey">
    <div class="bar-grey" style="width:20%"></div>
  </div>
</div>

???

Then, we will upscale the model to national scale, at this phase, we will conduct a national scale simulation.

--

<br>

**Aim 4**: Explore the potential of scenario modelling in the policy optimisation to tackle urban economic segregation in the Netherlands

**Paper 4**: Scenario agent-based simulations of mitigating strategies on urban economic segregation in the Netherlands

???

The last one will be extending the validated national scale baseline model to a multi policy scenario simulations. Thus, we aims to explore the potential of scenario modelling in the policy optimisation to mitigate urban economic segregation in the Netherlands.

<!-- Slide 06: The entities of the ABM -->

.right[.image-90[![](../imgs/whatisABM/whatisABM_layers.svg)]]

## Basic Elements of ABM

### Entities

In ABM, there are typically two layers of entities: the actor layer and the environment layer:

- Actors

  In the model, the entity is individual which forms the unit of housing decision, **household**.

- Environment

  **Land unit** and **living unit** are the the passive agents that constitutes the environment layer.

<!-- About Agent-Based Modelling: Rules and interactions -->

.right[![](../imgs/design/theoreticalframework.svg)
.caption[.center[Theoretical framework from micro behaviours <br>to social phenomena through ABM]]]

## Agent-Based Modelling

### Rules

- The rules guides how the agents behave and interact with each other.

- These rules are based on both dynamic and static attributes.

### Interactions

- Actors interact with each other and the environment, altering their states.

- The interactions can vary over time and space.

.caption[.center[Collection of the related ABMs from the literature]]]

Residential mobility is well-modelled due to its relevance in wide range of social phenomena.

Economic mobility is less modelled, especially in spatial contexts.

ABMs of segregation primarily discussed location in segregation but not the complexity of residential choice or economic behaviour.

# Review of Mechanisms

.right[![](../imgs/slr/slr_classificationclusters_tog.svg)
.caption[.center[Collection of the related ABMs from the literature]]]

Rather small number of ABMs captured the residential mobility and economic mobility simultaneously in the same segregation model.

## The key components and their interplay

**Residential Mobility Component**

The household make their residential decision, the residence location change can impact the social network change and the economic states.

## Gap

The tenure choice in residential mobility was widely researched theoretically, but rarely modelled together in ABM.

.caption[.center[Figure. The case of Groningen and its population density.]]

The [Functional Urban Areas (FUA)<sup>a</sup>](https://www.oecd.org/cfe/regionaldevelopment/functional-urban-areas.htm) of Groningen.

The population of FUA of Groningen is <u>194, 340</u> in 2011 census, aggregated to around <u>80, 000</u> households.

.note[*Notes: <sup>a</sup>: each of FUA consists of a densely inhabited city and of a surrounding area (commuting zone)*]

.caption[.center[Figure. An example of life trajectory, events and impact on household characteristics.]]]

**Fundamental stages and essential micro life events**

Life events have the potential to trigger relocation desires, influence preferences for residence and economic states.

<!-- Residential mobility component -->

.right[![](../imgs/design/utility_preference/preferencebasedutilitycalculation.svg)]

### The mechanisms of economic mobility

Residential Utility is defined by static attributes and dynamic preference varying over households.

The factors of perceived utility of housing include the accessibility to services, the living unit size fits the household size and the social group by income and demographic background<sup>a</sup>.

.note[*Notes: <sup>a</sup>: The preference level of residing with similar economic and demographic neighbours.*]

## Measurements of generated outcomes

### Statistical Measurements

### Spatial Measurements

---

## Model optimisation


## Model validation

### Sensitivity and robustness tests

### Generative realism

---

## Scenario modelling



---

## Evaluation

**What is the ideal ABM of urban economic segregation we are looking for?**

- A general decision making mindset

- A framework that simulated reliable micro behaviours

- A flexible and extendable framework

- A representative model of the target social phenomena with essential actors and mechanisms

---

## Overall challenges

### Diversity of individuals

  Without the diversity of individuals, the model might fail to capture endogenous dynamics of the main actors.

### The balance between the complexity and the simplicity of the model

  The more elements and the more detailed the behaviour and interaction rules, the larger the model needs to be and the longer the simulation will take.

### The interpretability of the model

  As the intercorrelation between different mechanisms, the impact of each mechanism is difficult to be isolated. 
  
  Sensitivity analysis and modelling them in building block will be the key to address this issue.
