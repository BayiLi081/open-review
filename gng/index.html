(30s) Good morning, thanks for coming to my go and no go presentation here and online. So today I will present my current progress and the plan for the next three years. The supervision team includes Professor Maarten, Tatiana, and Clémentine. The topic of my research is agent-based modelling of urban economic segregation in the Netherlands. 

---

<!-- Slide 02: Define the targeted social phenomenon -->

## What is Urban Economic Segregation?

The uneven distribution of groups with **different economic status** across **residential neighbourhoods** of a city or an urban region (adapted from Van Ham et al. (2021)).

<div class="probar-footer">
  <div class="bar-light-grey">
    <div class="bar-grey" style="width:3%"></div>
  </div>
</div>

???

(50s) To study urban economic segregation, we fist need to define the term first. We see urban economic segregation as the uneven distribution of groups with different economic status across residential neighbourhoods of a city or an urban region.

--

## Multi-faceted issue of Urban Economic Segregation

- Residential

  Why do people choose to live where they live?

- Economic

  What drove the people's economic status change over time?

???

(1m'10s) Therefore, the phenomenon can basically interpreted as two facets: residential and economic. So two related fundamental questions are: 1. Why do people choose to live where they live? 2. How the their economic status change over time?

--

## Complexity of Urban Economic Segregation

A complex interplay of family, housing, financial and market factors, influenced by local circumstances.

???

(1m'30s) Regarding the two question and the complex theory, urban economic segregation can be described by interconnected networks of households, being effected by a complex interplay of family, housing, financial and market factors, influenced by local circumstances.

<!-- Slide 03: Introduce of agent-based approach -->

.right[.image-90[![](../imgs/whatisABM/generative_abm_mechanism.svg)].image-70[![](../imgs/whatisABM/whatisABM_outcomes.svg)]]

## Generative Method

> Epstein (2006): If you didn't grow it, you didn't explain it emergence.

A computational simulation that emerges the pattern of economic segregation based on the designated mechanisms and their interplay.

## Agent-Based Modelling

It generates the urban economic segregation through **autonomous residential and economic decisions, and local interactions of heterogeneous agents**. 

Agent-based models allow us to capture **aspects of systems** that conventional modelling does not permit.

## Causal Mechanisms

A method to address complex social phenomena by searching for **causal mechanisms** that exhibit generative power  of target social phenomena (Epstein 2006, Hedström 2005).

<div class="probar-footer">
  <div class="bar-light-grey">
    <div class="bar-grey" style="width:10%"></div>
  </div>
</div>

???

(1m'50s) Generative approach is used to understand and explain urban economic segregation in this complexity. In this sense, the target is to grow the pattern of urban economic segregation in a computational simulation from designated framework.

(2m'10s) Specifically, we are using agent-based modelling to describe complex behaviours as a generative process from bottom up to the collective segregation pattern.
ABMs are a bottom-up approach of generative modelling where **heterogenous entities** make autonomous decisions of actions, based on their evolution and that of other entities. ABMs allow us to capture aspects of systems, such as emergent properties generated from the interaction, that conventional modelling does not permit. 

In addition, the mechanism-based ABM is capable of searching for causal mechanism that exhibit generative power of urban economic segregation.

# Overview

## Overarching Research Question

**How can agent-based modelling help us understand the crucial mechanisms which drove urban economic segregation happened in the Netherlands?**

<br>

</div>

???

The overall research question to ask in the project, therefore, is formulated as how can agent-based modelling help us understand the crucial mechanisms which drove urban economic segregation happened in the Netherlands?

--

## Overall Research Aim

**Build an agent-based model, involving the main mechanisms of urban economic segregation and their interplays, to simulate the evolution of residential pattern in the Dutch cities.**

???

Hence, the aim is to build an agent-based model, involving the main mechanisms of urban economic segregation and their interplays, to simulate the evolution of residential pattern in the Dutch cities.

## Review of ABM of UES

### Generative Mechanism and Empirically Grounded ABMs

.image-60[![](../imgs/slr/metainfo_litreview.jpg)]

Large scale empirically grounded agent-based models are not sufficiently address the issue of segregation, let alone in the context of the Netherlands.

<div class="probar-footer">
  <div class="bar-light-grey">
    <div class="bar-grey" style="width:25%"></div>
  </div>
</div>

???

First, we conducted a review on the ABMs of segregation. We can see the scattered case studies does not provide sufficient explanation on the Netherlands context. There are large portion of abstract ABMs without considering the context. And there are rarely a national-scale ABM in segregation.

---

## Review of ABM of UES

### Other observation

Weakness | Our contribution

- The interplay between mechanisms were largely overlooked

- Overly reliance on assumptions with hypothetical parameter set without empirical support

- We need better ways of populating such models with realistic agent behaviours. 

- We has no sufficient scientific and engineering methodology for calibrating and validating such model.

- There is a need of large ABMs to address the multi-scale of urban economic segregation.

<div class="probar-footer">
  <div class="bar-light-grey">
    <div class="bar-grey" style="width:25%"></div>
  </div>
</div>

???

In addition, we have other observations on the former ABMs of segregation:

- Single mechanism still dominant the literature, which means, the interplay between mechanisms were largely overlooked

- There are huge amount of abstract ABMs. Among them, overly reliance on assumptions with hypothetical parameter set without empirical support

- We need better ways of populating such models with realistic agent behaviours

- Calibration, validation and robustness analysis are not well conducted, even in empirically grounded ABMs. We has no sufficient scientific and engineering methodology for calibrating and validating such model.

-  As we said, there is rarely large ABM, thus, the segregation was not sufficiently discussed at multiple scale.

<br>

The rich information (i.e., housing, demographical and socioeconomic attributes of residents) in the microdata will provide an unprecedented opportunity to ground the model empirically.

<div class="probar-footer">

???

In this project, the microdata will be used to power the model and integrated with initialisation of environment and entities, also inspire the decision rule parameters, and also involved with the model calibration and verification process. The application of such granular data, not usually accessible in other countries. Not only it will fine-graining our model but also provide methodological contribution of how to apply such data in a ABM.

## Basic Elements of ABM

### Entities

In ABM, there are typically two layers of entities: the actor layer and the environment layer:

- Actors

  In the model, the entity is individual which forms the unit of housing decision, **household**

???

The household make their residential decision, the residence location change can impact the social network change and the economic states.

Residential mobility is well-modelled due to its relevance in wide range of social phenomena.

Economic mobility is less modelled, especially in spatial contexts.

	At each simulation cycle, the model produces a map of household residences with their respective economic states attached. Additionally, the spatial aspects of segregation are calculated using land units to ensure consistency in measurement at the microspatial level across different cities. Tentative measurements include clustering (local Moran's I) and concentration (global Moran's I). In this context, the areas of spatial concentration of poor and affluent can be compared to observed patterns of concentration.

  - Realism of economic status: Statistical distribution of economic attributes

## Overall challenges

### Diversity of individuals

  Without the diversity of individuals, the model might fail to capture endogenous dynamics of the main actors.

### The balance between the complexity and the simplicity of the model

  The more elements and the more detailed the behaviour and interaction rules, the larger the model needs to be and the longer the simulation will take.

### The interpretability of the model

  As the intercorrelation between different mechanisms, the impact of each mechanism is difficult to be isolated. 
  
  Sensitivity analysis and modelling them in building block will be the key to address this issue.

Questions?

???

25 min time

---

**Appendix 01: what are our contributions of doing such ABM-UES?**

Axelrod and Tesfatsion (2005) points out four goals of ABM:

1. Empirical understanding: seek causal explanations

  This corresponds to the overall project aim of understanding the crucial mechanisms of economic segregation in the Netherlands.

2. Normative understanding: as laboratories for the discovery of good designs (e.g., policies)

  This corresponds to our paper 4.

3. Heuristic: this refers to the counterfactual outcomes could be generated from fundamental causal mechanism. 

  Mostly for abstract ABM, not our goal

4. Methodological advancement: To provide the researchers with rigorous tools to conduct controlled computational experiments.

  This corresponds to our methodological principles such as large scale and modular ABM.

---

**Appendix 02: the challenge of large model**

> More is Different

- The model contains extensive number of agents with a variety of heterogeneity.

- The multi mechanisms adopted

  Modular approach makes it possible to introduce new mechanisms and reduce the non-significant mechanisms.

---

**Appendix 03: the potential changing optimal structure over time**

We are not considering the change of decision making framework over time. It can explain there were rarely abrupt changes .

???

In our project, the mechanism at certain context was considered as stable over time. Of course, it is because we select the endogenous mechanisms on purpose and deliberately omit unexpected events, etc. For example, three years of pandemics significantly change people's worklocation and threfore, xxxx. We have the temporal variation in mind, and will examine it if any irregularity was observed from the empirical data or simulated outcomes.

---

**Appendix 04: the extensive computational cost**

1. We have allocate the resources to computing task on a HPC

2. Given that the aim of the project is to understand urban economic segregation, we will not consider mathematical approaches to reduce the complexity, in paper 2 and 3, for example, machine learning or dimension reduction. However, if time permits, we can explore the mathematically grounded simplification of ABM to balance the potential high computational power increase brought by varying multiple parameter set.
