Good morning, thanks for coming to my go and no go presentation here and online. So today I will present my current progress and the plan for the next three years. The supervision team includes Professor Maarten, Tatiana, and Clémentine. The topic of my research is agent-based modelling of urban economic segregation in the Netherlands. 

---

## What is Urban Economic Segregation?

The uneven distribution of groups with **different economic status** across **residential neighbourhoods** of a city or an urban region (adapted from Van Ham et al. (2021)).

## Multi-faceted issue of Urban Economic Segregation

- Residential

  Why do people choose to live where they live?

- Economic

  How the their economic status change over time?

--

## Complexity of Urban Economic Segregation

A complex interplay of family, housing, education and labour market factors, influenced by local circumstances.

## Agent-Based Modelling

Agent-based modelling, a bottom-up generative approach, generates the social phenomena through **autonomous decisions and local interactions of heterogeneous agents**.

--

A method to address complex social phenomena by searching for possible mechanisms that exhibit generative power **(causal mechanism)** of target social phenomena (Epstein 2006, Hedström 2005).

---

.right[.image-90[![](../imgs/whatisABM/whatisABM_layers.svg)]]

## Agent-Based Modelling

ABMs are a bottom-up approach of generative modelling where **heterogenous entities** make autonomous decisions of actions, based on their evolution and that of other entities.

### Entities

In ABM, there are typically two layers of entities: the actor layer and the environment layer:

- Actors

  The human actors, <u>active agents</u>, can move around and interact with other entities. 

- Environment

  The environment, <u>passive agents</u>, is where the active agents reside.

<!-- About Agent-Based Modelling: Rules and interactions -->

.right[.image-90[![](../imgs/whatisABM/whatisABM_envimpact.svg)]]

## Agent-Based Modelling

### Rules

- The rules guides how the agents behave and interact with each other.

- These rules are based on both dynamic and static attributes.

### Interactions

- Actors interact with each other and the environment, altering their states.

- The interactions can vary over time and space.

<div class="summary-footer"> Emergent phenomena result from the interactions, which are driven by a set of rules.</div>

.caption[.center[Collection of the related ABMs from the literature]]]

Residential mobility is well-modelled due to its relevance in wide range of social phenomena.

Economic mobility is less modelled, especially in spatial contexts.

ABMs of segregation primarily discussed location in segregation but not the complexity of residential choice or economic behaviour.

# Review

.right[![](../imgs/slr/slr_classificationclusters_tog.svg)
.caption[.center[Collection of the related ABMs from the literature]]]

Rather small number of ABMs captured the residential mobility and economic mobility simultaneously in the same segregation model.

# Review

## The key actors

- **Household**

  Household is the most common actor modelled in related ABM.
    
- **Individual**

  Individual, may called agent, is commonly modelled as the member of household. 
  
  Depending on the social phenomena and mechanism selected, the individual agent can be substituted by other actors.

- **Other actors**
  
  The other actors, developer, urban sector or government, etc, are modelled as actor of interests in some ABMs which involves dynamic planning process. 

  <div class="probar-footer"><div class="bar-light-grey"><div class="bar-grey" style="width:65%"></div></div></div>
  
---

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_lifecourse_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Life Course Component**

The life course regulates the internal attributes of the agent, posing event and transition as a trigger of further responses on residential and economic mobility.

<div class="probar-footer"><div class="bar-light-grey"><div class="bar-grey" style="width:70%"></div></div></div>

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_residentialmobility_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Residential Mobility Component**

The household make their residential decision, the residence location change can impact the social network change and the economic states.

<div class="probar-footer"><div class="bar-light-grey"><div class="bar-grey" style="width:75%"></div></div></div>

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_economicmobility_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Economic Mobility Component**

The economic states change can impact the residential decision.

<div class="probar-footer"><div class="bar-light-grey"><div class="bar-grey" style="width:80%"></div></div></div>

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_socialnetwork_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Social Network Component**

Social networks serve as a foundational mechanism for capturing the complexities of social influence on behaviour.

<div class="probar-footer"><div class="bar-light-grey"><div class="bar-grey" style="width:85%"></div></div></div>

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_macroregulation_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Macro Level Regulation**

The macro level regulation was conceptualised  as the exogenous dynamics. 

It can impact the economic states and the residential decision. 

It imitates the role of policy interventions, and will be used to create the policy scenarios.

# Review

## The knowledge base

The location-based opportunity is well captured in the ABMs of urban migration by uneven development or specific function-oriented location choice such as job-oriented or education-oriented.

## Gap

The tenure choice in residential mobility was widely researched theoretically, but rarely modelled together in ABM.

## Prototype Model design

### Case study

.image-40[![](../imgs/nl_casestudy_locationdes.jpg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. The case of Groningen and its population density.]]

The [Functional Urban Areas (FUA)<sup>a</sup>](https://www.oecd.org/cfe/regionaldevelopment/functional-urban-areas.htm) of Groningen.

The population of FUA of Groningen is <u>194, 340</u> in 2011 census, aggregated to around <u>80, 000</u> households.

.note[*Notes: <sup>a</sup>: each of FUA consists of a densely inhabited city and of a surrounding area (commuting zone)*]

### The life course component

.right[![](../imgs/design/lifecoursemodel/example_life_course_001.svg)
.caption[.center[Figure. An example of life trajectory, events and impact on household characteristics.]]]

**Fundamental stages and essential micro life events**

The trajectories of individuals and households are intertwined with each other through the life events.

### The life course component

.right[![](../imgs/design/lifecoursemodel/example_life_course_002.svg)
.caption[.center[Figure. An example of life trajectory, events and impact on household characteristics.]]]

**Fundamental stages and essential micro life events**

Life events have the potential to trigger relocation desires, influence preferences for residence and economic states.

---

<!-- Residential mobility component -->

.right[![](../imgs/design/utility_preference/preferencebasedutilitycalculation.svg)]

### Residential mobility component

#### The residential utility

Residential Utility is defined by static attributes and dynamic preference varying over households.

The factors of perceived utility of housing include the accessibility to services, the living unit size fits the household size and the social group by income and demographic background<sup>a</sup>.

.note[*Notes: <sup>a</sup>: The preference level of residing with similar economic and demographic neighbours.*]

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/housingsearchprocess/utility_comparison.svg)]

#### The housing decision process

<!-- preference, expectation, affordability, decision -->

Rules:

  The household will start the housing searching process if the utility of the current housing is lower than the expected utility.

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/housingsearchprocess/bidding_simplified.svg)]

#### The housing decision process

<!-- preference, expectation, affordability, decision -->

Rules:

  Household with higher disposable income on housing has <u>the priority</u> to select the housing units.

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/housingsearchprocess/finalisethelist.svg)]

#### The housing decision process

<!-- preference, expectation, affordability, decision -->

Rules:

  The household will <u>increase the searching radius</u> if there is no qualified housing unit within the current searching radius.

---

<!-- Entities introduction starts here -->

### Entities (**change it more design related**)

.right[![](../imgs/design/entity-des/entities_individual_50.svg)]

#### Individuals

The individuals are the smallest active agent.

--

The dynamic choice attributes are updated based on the former experience.

The dynamic state attributes are the properties or characteristics of agents that can change over time as the simulation progresses.

---

### Entities (**change it more design related**)

.right[![](../imgs/design/entity-des/entities_household_50.svg)]

#### Household

The individuals are the members of the household<sup>a</sup>, and the household is the minimum relocation decision making unit of the model.

.note[*Notes: <sup>a</sup> The household covers the family and non-family household. The family household is the household with at least two members, and the non-family household is the household with one adult member.*]

---

### Entities (**change it more design related**)

.right[![](../imgs/design/entity-des/entities_livingunit_50.svg)
]

#### Living Unit

The living units are the housing units in the grids of residence.

---

### Entities (**change it more design related**)

.right[![](../imgs/design/entity-des/entities_spatialunit_50.svg)
]

#### Spatial Unit

The spatial units are the environment where the active agents live in. 

In our case, they are the grids of the city.

<!-- Entities introduction ends here -->

---

## Limitations of the prototype model to be developed

### Decision rule

Some of rules are largely simplified, for example, the behaviour in housing market.

### The tolerance of the decision

At circumstances of certain events, such as job change or divorce, the tolerance of the residential decision will be increased.

### Absence of migration flow in and out of the system

The long-distance migration flow in and out of the system is not included in the prototype model. 

---

## Overall challenges

### Diversity of individuals

  Without the diversity of individuals, the model might fail to capture endogenous dynamics of the main actors.

### The balance between the complexity and the simplicity of the model

  The more elements and the more detailed the behaviour and interaction rules, the larger the model needs to be and the longer the simulation will take.

### The interpretability of the model

  As the intercorrelation between different mechanisms, the impact of each mechanism is difficult to be isolated. 
  
  Sensitivity analysis and modelling them in building block will be the key to address this issue.

# Evaluation

**What is the ideal ABM of urban economic segregation we are looking for?**

- A general decision making mindset

- A framework that simulated reliable micro behaviours

- A flexible and extendable framework

- A representative model of the target social phenomena with essential actors and mechanisms
