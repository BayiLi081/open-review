## About me

### Personal trajectory

???
30s

- I'd like to start by giving you a brief introduction to my background and academic journey.

- I grew up in a small town in the southern but close to middle of China.

- Later, I migrated to the Guangzhou with my family, one of the biggest cities in the real southern part.

- I finished my undergraduate studies in the Shanghai University, then steered myself for my master's degree in Geographical Information Science at Edinburgh.

- After completing my master's degree, I took on the role of a GIS analyst in Reading. Then I joined a research team as a research assistant in Singapore, where I started my research career. Finally, I am here, as a PhD student.

- The crazy migration trajectory is not only a personal experience, but also an example of migration driven by life events, which is one of the key components of my research. I will talk about it later.

## About Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)

.right[.image-90[![](../imgs/whatisABM.svg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. The basic structure of an agent-based model <br> adapted from (Nikolic, 2012; Manley, 2013)]]]

ABM is a bottom-up approach to modelling, which builds understanding of **complex social phenomena** from **individual behaviours** regulated by <u>simple rules and interactions</u>.

> The components of an agent-based model are <u>a collection of agents and their states</u>, <u>the rules</u> governing the **interactions of the agents** and <u>the environment</u> within which they live. (Shalizi, 2006)

**Active agents** are the <u>entities (human actors)</u> that can move around and interact with each other. **Passive agents** are the <u>environment</u> where the active agents live in.

The active agents are guided by **rules** that define their behaviour and interaction. The rules are based on the **dynamic attributes** (e.g., own states, social tie, etc) and the **static attributes** (e.g., the social norms, etc).

Active agents **interact** with each other and the passive agents, altering their states. The <u>social and environmental impacts</u> contribute to **the phenomena of the system** collectively.

???

- ABM is a bottom-up approach to modelling.

- It aims to understand complex social phenomena by simulating individual behaviours governed.

- The components of an agent-based model consist of three key elements: a collection of agents and their states, the rules governing the interactions of the agents, and the environment within which they live.

- Active agents in agent-based modeling are the entities, often represented as human actors, capable of moving around and interacting with each other.

- Passive agents represent the environment in which the active agents reside.

- The behaviour of active agents is guided by rules that define how they behave and interact with each other.

- These rules are based on both dynamic attributes (such as the agent's own states and social ties) and static attributes (such as social norms).

- Active agents interact with each other and with the environment.

- These interactions lead to changes in the state of the system.

- These social and environmental impacts collectively contribute to the emergence of phenomena within the system.

## About ABM

### Approaches of ABM

.right[.image-90[![](../imgs/design/typeofABM.svg)]
.caption[.center[Approaches and theory basis to design agents’ behaviours in ABMs <br>(adapted from Ravaioli et al. (2023) and Mehdizadeh (2022))]]]

- **Theory-based ABM**

  The pros of theory-based model is that it is more interpretable and generalisable, but the cons is that it may oversimplify the reality.

- **Heuristic ABM**

  The pros of heuristic model is that it is more flexible and exploratory, but the cons is that it has limited generalisability and more subjectivity.

- **Data-driven ABM**
  
  The pros of data-driven model is that it is more accurate, but the cons is that it is hard to interpret and understand the model.

*Notes: Data driven ABM rises from the development of machine learning and big data. But given that one of our research aim is to understand the mechanism of urban economic segregation, we will not be focusing on this approach.*

???

There are three approaches to designing agents' behaviours in ABMs: theory-based, heuristic, and data-driven. The major difference is the rule and the theory basis of the rule.

- Theory-based ABMs are grounded in established theories, making it easier to understand and explain the model's behavior. These models can be applied to various scenarios, thanks to their theoretical foundations. However, theory-based ABMs may oversimplify the complex reality they aim to simulate, potentially missing important nuances and interactions.

- Heuristic ABMs are adaptable and allow for more exploratory modelling, making them suitable for case study and scenarios with uncertain or evolving dynamics. However, heuristic ABMs may not easily translate to different contexts due to their reliance on ad-hoc rules. These models may incorporate subjective judgments or assumptions, introducing potential bias.

- Data-driven ABMs are based on empirical data, making them more accurate and realistic. However, these models are difficult to interpret and understand, and they may not be generalizable to other contexts.

The former two approaches are the main approaches of ABM, and the data-driven ABM is rising from the development of machine learning and big data. Rule-based ABM usually combine the theory-based and heuristic approaches. That's select the mechanism from established theories, parametrise the rules based on empirical data, and include the rule of thumb (based on practical experience rather than theory).

The choice of approach depends on the specific goals and characteristics of the modelling study.

<!-- The overview of the ABM's theoretical framework -->

# Overview

.right[.image-80[![](../imgs/design/theoreticalframework.svg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. Theoretical framework of connecting behaviours,<br>simulation and social phenomena using ABM]]]

## The target social phenomena

**Urban economic segregation**

> The uneven distribution of groups with **different economic status** across **residential neighbourhoods** of a city or an urban region (adapted from Van Ham et al. (2021)).

Two fundamental questions:

- Why do people choose to live where they live?

- How the their economic status change over time?

## Purpose

- To simulate the urban economic segregation as collective social phenomena of <u>micro residential mobility and economic mobility behaviours</u> over individual's life course.

- To gain a deeper understanding of the broader social dynamics and their interplay that contribute to urban economic segregation.

- To provide simulated evidence from scenarios modelling of policy interventions for policy makers.

???

- Our research focuses on the social phenomenon: "Urban economic segregation". We interpret this term as the spatial differences of groups with different economic status across neighbourhoods. It indicates two essential aspects: location and economic status. 

  (Van Ham et al., 2021: Urban Socio-Economic Segregation and Income Inequality: A Global Perspective)

- Therefore, we aim to address two fundamental questions:

  1. "Why do people live where they live?" - This question addresses the factor of residential choices. 
  
    This facet examines how a resident unit make decisions about where they choose to live within an urban area.

  2. "How does an individual's economic status change over time?" - This question pertains to the dynamics of economic mobility.
  
    This aspect explores how an individual's economic status evolves over their life course.

- From the framework, the micro social simulation at large scale connects the housing decision, economic behaviours and the residential and economic states changes, leading to the emerged pattern of economic segregation.

The purpose is to build a reliable modelling framework to have better understand the broader social dynamics and their interplay that contribute to urban economic segregation. Further development regarding the multi policy scenario analysis will provide simulated evidence for policy makers.

???

From theory development, scale of modelling and complexity, the project is divided into four phases, also the years of the PhD. 

- The first phase is a systematic literature review of former ABMs of segregation, residential mobility and economic mobility. This is to gain the insights on what has been modelled or not, how they set up the rules and processes, and the gap between theory and practice. 

- Meanwhile, we started a prototype model focus on one key component, residential mobility, based on the case of Groningen. Considering the technical challenges of building all at one time, we start from one component and one city, and then incrementally expand the model to other components and larger scale.

- So, the year two will be focus on the further development of other components, and the calibration and validation of the model based on the case of Groningen.

- The fourth phase is to conduct policy scenario analysis. The model will be extended to incorporate more contextual factors, such as the macroeconomic factors, the policy interventions, etc. The model will be used to test the impact of policy interventions on the urban economic segregation, and provide practical recommendations and strategies.

# Review

## The key actors

The key actors 

Depending on the social phenomena and mechanism selected, the key actors of the model are different. The key actors of the model are summarised as the following table:

- **Household**

  The household is the key actor of the model, which is the basic unit of the model. The household is the agent of the model, which is the active agent of the model. The household is the environment of the model, which is the passive agent of the model.

- **Renter/Tenant and homeowner**

# Review

## The key components

  The theory-based model is prominent in the literature of ABM of urban economic segregation. The key actors and their decision and behaviour rules are summarised as the following table:

- **Life transition**

  Life course is widely used for modelling long term social phenomena. Especially for the ABM with long term simulation, life stage transition is increasingly being modelled in ABMs of residential mobility, approached by early lifecycle model <sup>[1, ]</sup> to the more dynamic life course model <sup>[2, ]</sup>.

  The evolution of household (e.g., household formation, household dissolution, etc), the individual (e.g., birth, death, etc) have been investigated and validated to have impact on residential choice ().

???

We are planning to simulate from when the data is available, the year 2011. The decade length period enables the agent to have sufficient time to more through their life course.

## The key components and their interplay

.right[![](../imgs/design/ResearchDesignStructure_supersimplified.svg)
.caption[.center[Figure. Diagram of the process components and their interplay]]]

The decision making central is the core of the model, divided into five components:

- **Life Course Component**

  The life course regulates the internal attributes of the agent, posing event and transition as a trigger of further responses on residential and economic mobility.

- **Residential Mobility Component**

  The household make their residential decision, the residence location change can impact the social network change and the economic states.

## The key components and their interplay

.right[![](../imgs/design/ResearchDesignStructure_supersimplified.svg)
.caption[.center[Figure. Diagram of the process components and their interplay]]]

- **Economic Mobility Component**

  The economic states change can impact the residential decision.

- **Social Network Component**

  The social network can impact the residential decision through social impact.  

- **Macro Level Regulation**  
  
  The exogenous dynamics is the core of the model, which is the decision making central of the model. The exogenous dynamics is the environment of the model, which is the passive agent of the model.

# Review

## Mechanisms and processes

- Pure theory-based ABM 

- The life stage transition is increasingly being modelled in ABMs of residential mobility, approached by early lifecycle model <sup>[1, ]</sup> to the more dynamic life course model <sup>[2, ]</sup>.

Three central components of migration behaviour include (Wolpert, 1965):

- The notion of place utility

- The field theory approach to search behaviour

- The life-cycle approach to threshold formation

Not all processes was modelled in former ABMs, and the processes are not always consistent with the theory. The key mechanisms and their sub-processes are summarised as the following table:

<!-- Prototype Model design -->

## Prototype Model design

### Case study

I propose **Groningen, the Netherlands** as the case study of this research. 

.image-40[![](../imgs/nl_casestudy_locationdes.jpg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. The case of Groningen and its population density.]]

The environment we used in the prototype model is the [Functional Urban Areas (FUA)<sup>a</sup>](https://www.oecd.org/cfe/regionaldevelopment/functional-urban-areas.htm). The population of FUA of Groningen is 194, 340 (474, 000 (total population) \* 41%) in 2011 census.

*Notes: <sup>a</sup>: developed by OECD and the European Commission, each of FUA consists of a densely inhabited city and of a surrounding area (commuting zone)*

???

The reason is that it is more if a standalone city than a metropolitan region which is more suitable for the preliminary stage of this research without too much external influence. Even consider the out-of-system migration flow, it is easier to measure and parameterized from the micro data.

The population of FUA of Groningen is around two hundred thousand. After being aggregated to household level, the total number of household will be around 80,000. The number is computable on a personal computer.

I intend this preliminary work to highlight the role of residential mobility across individuals' life course to contribute to economic segregation.

---

### Entities

.right[.image-100[![](../imgs/design/entity-des/entities_overview.svg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. The entities in the model and their attributes.]]]

There are two types of agents in the model: active agents and passive agents.

Active agents, including the **individuals and household**, are the key actors of the model. The individuals are the members of the household<sup>a</sup>, and the household is the minimum decision making unit of the model.

Passive agents, including **spatial units and living units**, are the environment where the active agents live in. The spatial units are the grids of the city, and the living units are the housing units in the grids of residence.

The attributes of entities was designed with extendability with other components (e.g., the marriage preference, tie, residence tenure type, etc.). Some of the attributes are fixed, while others are dynamic.

*Notes: <sup>a</sup> The household covers the family and non-family household. The family household is the household with at least two members, and the non-family household is the household with one adult member.*

???

Active agents consist of individuals and households. Let's break this down further:
- Individuals: These are the people who make up the households.

- Households: Think of households as the decision-making units. They are the smallest entities within our model that make choices.

  Small notes on that one adult was seen as an one-person household in our model, this is also consistent with the definition of the CBS household summary.

Passive agents represent the environment where active agents operate. These include spatial units and living units:

- Spatial Units: These are essentially the grids that make up our city. They form the backdrop where our active agents interact.

- Living Units: These are the housing units within the grids of residence. They provide the physical spaces where our active agents live.

We designed the attributes of these entities to incorporate more mechanisms from other components such as marriage preferences, social ties, and residence tenure types.


Among these attributes, some attributes are fixed, while others change dynamically as the model runs.

---

### Entities

#### Environment Attributes Measurement

.image-50[![](../imgs/design/entity-des/passive_agents_des.svg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. The passive agents (Spatial units and Living units) and their attributes.]]

The attributes of the passive agents are the spatial attributes and the housing attributes.

At neighbourhood level, there are some neighbourhood characteristics to be assigned for each land unit of residence, where the neighbourhood is defined by spatial continuity. Similar with accessibility to service, but this threshold is 400 meters.

???

There are some native attributes, but also some derivative attributes, such as occupy status and neighbourhood social group, which will be calculated for each step.

Upper level than each land unit is the neighbourhood, which is defined by spatial continuity. Similar with accessibility to service, but this threshold is 400 meters. But overall, these attributes will be assigned to the land units instead of creating a new type of agent.

---

<!-- The life course component -->

### The life course component

The life course model will be a simplified version of the real life course with **fundamental stages and essential events**. Most of them will be parametrised based on probability distribution mirroring the empirical data (e.g., birth rate, marriage rate, death rate); some of them follows a certain sequence or schedule (e.g., Birth -> being independent).

.image-90[![](../imgs/design/lifecoursemodel/example_life_course.svg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. An example of life trajectory, events and impact on household characteristics.]]

???

- Our goal with this model is to capture the key milestones and transitions that were validated in former studies. 

- We've divided the life course into several fundamental stages and essential events. These stages and events are parametrized based on probability distributions that mirror real-world data. For example, we consider birth rates, marriage rates, and death rates when defining these events.

- Some of these events follow a specific sequence or schedule. For instance, you have to have a partner to break up, you have to have a job to retire, ect.

- This diagram showcases an example life trajectory of two people, highlighting various events and their impact on household characteristics. It's a snapshot of how our model brings together events and transitions that shape individuals' and households' life courses.

<!-- The life course component -->

### The life course component

#### The life events

.right[.image-100[![](../imgs/design/lifecoursemodel/example_life_event.svg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. The key life stages and life events of a household <br> and their impact on other components.]]]

Micro life events<sup>a</sup>, happening in a household or individual life trajectory, could trigger the relocation desire and affect the preference for residence and affordability for the move. 

These micro events can be further categorised into individual and family events. These two types of events are applied to the household and individual respectively.

<!-- the table of representative life events -->

| Type | | Event |
| --- | - | --- |
| **Individual Event** |:| Job switch, decease, etc. |
| **Family Event** |:| Marry, divorce, give birth, etc. |

These events will act as trigger<sup>b</sup> of further responses on residential and economic mobility.

*Notes: <sup>a</sup>: Macro events included unexpected events such as the economic crisis, the pandemic, the war, etc. They will not be included for not being our focus, but the **more consistent long-term macro regulators** such as the interest rate, immigrants number and employment rate will be included in the exogenous dynamics section.*

*<sup>b</sup>: Triggering events resulting from the progression in a households’ life course career can be categorised into **opportunities, problems to solve, and radical changes**.<sup>3, 4</sup>*

???

- This diagram illustrates the essential life stages and life events that households and individuals experience and how they impact house size requirement, preferences and disposable income on housing, that is affordability.

- These are events that occur within individual or household life trajectories, and they have the potential to trigger relocation desires and influence preferences for residence and affordability for moving.

- As a note, the life events included in life course component is micro life events, we're focusing on micro events within our model. While macro events such as economic crises, pandemics, and wars exist in the real world, we've excluded them to concentrate on more consistent long-term macro regulators like interest rates, immigration numbers, and employment rates, which we'll address separately in the exogenous dynamics section.

- It can be categorized into two main types: individual events and family events. They can occur within individual or household life trajectories, served as triggers for subsequent responses in terms of residential and economic mobility.

- Different kinds of trigger events can have different mechanism and influence intensity in the further responses. It will be internalised in a specific process.

<!-- Residential mobility component -->

### Residential mobility component

#### The residential utility

Residential Utility is defined by static attributes and the preference for different residential options based on various economic, demographic, and social attributes of households. We assume that the households with similar characteristics have similar preference.

The preference is simplified to impact perceived utility of housing, which is based on the accessibility to services, the living unit size fits the household size and the social group by income and demographic background<sup>a</sup>.

.image-50[![](../imgs/design/preference/preference_composition.svg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. Expectation, preference and affordability of a household and a house unit.]]

*Notes: <sup>a</sup>: The preference level of residing with similar economic and demographic neighbours.*

???

- To simplify this complex concept of preference, we've distilled it into something more manageable: the perceived utility of housing. Residential Utility is defined with static attributes and the preference for different residential options based on various economic, demographic, and social attributes of households.

- The diagram display some expectations from economic, demographic and social aspects. They impact the weight of the preference for different residential attributes.

- As a note, the preference level for residing with similar economic and demographic neighbors is a crucial aspect. It is common to parametrise it as a global parameter, allowing us to create different scenarios.

---

### The preference

#### Utility-based comparison

Example of utility calculation based on the accessibility to services.

From the land use data, we selected three types to match the expectation on the services: recreation, institutions and facilities, and transportation. Each of these has its own sub categories. The accessibility to services is counted within a 400 meter buffer.

.image-40[![](../imgs/design/place_accessibility_utility_calculation.svg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. The composition of utility based on accessibility to services.]]

???

- Let's illustrate this with an example of utility calculation based on the accessibility to services. Services here refer to amenities like recreation areas, institutions, facilities, and transportation options. 

- This diagram illustrates the composition of utility based on accessibility to services. It shows how different types of services contribute to the overall utility calculation.

- To measure accessibility to services, we use land use data. From this data, we've selected three types that align with our expectations regarding services: recreation, institutions and facilities, and transportation. Each of these types has its own subcategories.

- The key idea is to calculate the accessibility to these services within a 400-meter buffer around a given location. This buffer represents a reasonable distance that individuals are willing to travel to access essential services.

---

.image-30[![](../imgs/example_service_accessibility_calculation_simplified.jpg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. Map of utility calculated from the accessibility to services based on the urban functions. <br>(b) Result for the scenario for the equal preferences for each attribute.]]

.image-30[![](../imgs/accservices_scenarios.jpg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. the theory of life in ABM and the key events to segregation. <br> (a): (2,1,1); (b): (1,2,1), (c): (1,1,2), (d): (2, 2,1)]]

???

These two maps shows the utility calculated from the accessibility to different services. The four scenarios are the perceived utility across the city for different preferences. For example, for the recreation-oriented household (probably younger household without child), they see the utility of all the residence grid as the first map. Of course, household does not have to evaluate all the grids, but only the reachable grids, which we will talk about it next.

---

#### The housing decision process
preference, expectation, affordability, decision

.right[![](../imgs/design/housingdecisionprocess.svg)
.caption[.center[Figure. The housing search process at one round of searching.]]]

Rules:

- The household will start the housing searching process if the utility of the current housing is lower than the expected utility.

- Household with higher disposable income on housing has <u>the priority</u> to select the housing units. Therefore, the household will not move if <u>the affordability is lower than the expected cost</u> of any of available housing units in list.

- The household will <u>increase the searching radius</u> if there is no qualified housing unit within the current searching radius.

- Currently the searching radius is fixed to their current residence for simplification reason, the following works could introduce <u>trigger-oriented searching radius</u> (e.g., job-oriented, education-oriented) and <u>social impacted searching radius</u> (e.g., proximity to relatives and current network).

???

- To model the housing decision process, we need to establish specific rules that households follow. Here are the key rules:

- The household initiates the housing searching process if the utility of their current housing is lower than their expected utility.

- Households with higher disposable income on housing enjoy priority in selecting housing units. Thus, they will not move if the affordability is lower than the expected cost of available housing units on their list.

- Households are willing to expand their searching radius if they cannot find a suitable housing unit within their current radius.

- Initially, the searching radius is fixed to the household's current residence. However, this radius can change based on specific circumstances. In future developments, we can consider trigger-oriented searching radius, such as job-oriented or education-oriented searches, as well as social-impact-oriented searching radius, which take into account factors like proximity to relatives and current social networks.

## Baseline model initialisation

### Baseline synthesis

It includes two parts: population socioeconomic synthesis environment spatial synthesis

#### Population socioeconomic synthesis

Generation of synthetic population at the zonal-level, which fits the nature of the Netherlands.
The population distribution matches the aged group population distribution and demographic characteristics in the aggregated 100 meter CBS grid and national household composition data.

.image-40[![](../imgs/synthetics/synthetic_household.jpg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. the synthetic household distribution by number of child in Groningen.]]


???

Notes:

There are some inconsistency in the population grid by CBS (for example, the total number of age groups != the total number of genders != total number provided), but in this case, as we will only be using the age and gender distribution, we just need these two to be consistent.

The under 25 population has large deviation from the real world. The issue mainly comes from the highly aggregated data doest not reflect the real age of leaving original household. It could be solved by using the micro data. But considering they are not the key actor, rather than a factor of choice preference of their parents, we will not be focusing on this issue.

---

#### Environment spatial synthesis

Create the space of land units where agents live, where each unit has a series of predefined spatial attributes:

1. Assign the land use type to the spatial units based on the land use map.

2. Calculate the fixed attributes of each spatial units of residence.

3. Assign the living units to the spatial units based on the CBS grids.

## Limitations of the prototype model to be developed

*Clearly, the prototype of model describes a type of idea space and decision making, which does not occur in practice. However, the ideal residential choice serves as a starting point for introducing further behaviours and mechanism, mentioned in other components, from our target of an ideal comprehensive model.*

### Error term

The error term is not included in the prototype model for simplification reason, which will be added into calculation.

### Connection with other components

The prototype model is a standalone model, which will be connected with other components in the future development.

### Environment initialisation without granular data input

For example, the heterogeneity of the type of living units in a spatial unit is generated from the probability distribution of the type of living units in the whole city. It will be further improved with granular data input. Same with household characteristics.

### Absence of migration flow in and out of the system

The long-distance migration flow in and out of the system is not included in the prototype model. As it is not correlated to utilities of specific living units, other potential decision-making process will be identified (e.g., expected utility model under risks) and modelled in the future development. Or, simplified as number summarised from the empirical data.

???

The error term is not included in the prototype model, which is a common practice in ABM. However, the error term is crucial in the model accuracy against the real world. The error term will be included in the future development of the model.

---

## Overall limitations and challenges

- The balance between the complexity and the simplicity of the model

  The more elements and the more detailed the behaviour and interaction rules, the larger the model needs to be and the longer the simulation will take.

  Modelling a city or country could be extremely computational consuming but not impossible as the development of computing power and new framework (e.g., distributed discrete event simulation)

  Several mechanisms may have little impact on the overall outcome of economic segregation. The model will be developed incrementally, and the impact of each mechanism will be evaluated.

  The more elements and the more detailed the behaviour and interaction rules, the larger the model needs to be and the longer the simulation will take.

#### Supplementary information for the project overview

##### Input data sources

- OECD report
- CBS Microdata
- Secondary survey data and former reports

##### Design concepts

- Basic principles

  Urban economic segregation is the collective outcome of individual's residential mobility and economic mobility behaviours over their life course.

- Emergence

  The spatial difference of economic status across residential neighbourhoods of a city or an urban region.

- Adaptation

  The active agent adjusts their preference, tolerance and expectation to their current condition and the environment.

- Fitness

  The goal of the household is to acquire the most suitable residence, based on their knowledge and cognitive skill, that fits their current demand and affordability.

---

##### Design concepts

- Learning

  The housing and relocation decision making is impacted by the experience of the household, such as the increasing relocation cost along with current location, residing years, tenure status, etc.

- Prediction

  The agents evaluate the utility of potential opportunities and the cost of their behaviours using environmental cues and embedded assumptions.

- Sensing

  What are agents assumed to know or perceive when making decisions?
  
  Is the sensing process itself explicitly modelled?

- Interaction

  The interactions include the form and decomposition of ties, the competition in the housing market, and the asset transfer through trading and inheritance.

---

##### Design concepts

- Stochasticity and uncertainty

  The heuristic rules are grounded in the empirical data, but the stochasticity is essential to keep the model simple and flexible.

  The parametrisation of rules and following variation of them in sensitivity analysis will be the key to understand the impact of each mechanism.

- Collectives

  The household is presented as a collective of individuals. It is being described in different way but the trait is intertwined with individual's life trajectory through the life course model.

- Observation

  A continuous time series of measurement on the uneven distribution of the household by income group and the economic status of the household.

  Other measurements depends on the calibration and validation process. For example, to validate the social network component, the evolution of social network of the household will be monitored.
