Hi, I am Bayi Li. 

Today, I am going to introduce the work progress of my PhD project, which focuses on agent-based modelling of urban economic segregation.

Supervised by Clementine. We are from the Urban Studies section at TU Delft.

## Agent-Based Modelling 

ABM is a bottom-up approach to modelling, simulating collective social phenomena from micro behaviours.

### Entities

In ABM, there are typically two layers of entities: the actor layer and the environment layer:

- Actors

  The human actors, <u>active agents</u>, can move around and interact with other entities. 

- Environment

  The environment, <u>passive agents</u>, is where the active agents reside.

???

So in ABM, entities refer to the actors and the environment.

- Active agents, often represented as human actors, capable of moving around and interacting with each other.

- Passive agents represent the environment in which the human actors reside and act.

---

<!-- About Agent-Based Modelling: Rules and interactions -->

.right[.image-90[![](../imgs/whatisABM/whatisABM_envimpact.svg)]]

## Agent-Based Modelling

### Rules

- The rules guides how the agents behave and interact with each other.

- These rules are based on both dynamic and static attributes.

### Interactions

- Actors interact with each other and the environment, altering their states.

- The interactions can vary over time and space.

???

Another key component of ABM is the rules.

- Rule-based ABM is the most common approach, where rules govern behaviours and interaction. 

- These rules could be based on both dynamic attributes (such as the agent's own states or social ties) and static attributes (such as social norms).

Rules guide interactions and interactions lead to changes in the state of other agents and environment.

The interactions can be dynamic, varying over time and space, in response to the changing circumstances.

## Agent-Based Modelling 

### Emergent Phenomena

- The actors' and environment's changing states indicate <u>social and environmental impacts</u> on the system.

- The social and environmental impacts contribute to <u>the phenomena of the system</u> collectively.

???

The social and environmental impacts can be observed through the changing states of the actors and the environment.

These impacts, collectively, contribute to the emergence of certain phenomena or pattern. 

In our case, it is the urban economic segregation.

<!-- The overview of the ABM's theoretical framework -->

# Overview

## The target social phenomena

**Urban economic segregation**

> The uneven distribution of groups with **different economic status** across **residential neighbourhoods** of a city or an urban region (adapted from Van Ham et al. (2021)).

???

But first, we interpret this term as the spatial differences of groups with different economic status across neighbourhoods. 

It indicates two essential aspects: location and economic status.

---

# Overview

## The target social phenomena

**Urban economic segregation**

> The uneven distribution of groups with **different economic status** across **residential neighbourhoods** of a city or an urban region (adapted from Van Ham et al. (2021)).

Two fundamental questions:

- Why do people choose to live where they live?

- How the their economic status change over time?

???

Therefore, we aim to address two fundamental questions:

- "Why do people live where they live?"
  
  This question addresses the factor of residential choices.

- And "How does an individual's economic status change over time?" 

  This question pertains to the dynamics of economic mobility.

### Research question

How can agent-based modelling enhance our understanding of the <u>dynamics driving urban economic segregation patterns</u> through the study of **individual residential and economic behaviours and interactions** in cities?

???

Then, we form our research question as:

How can agent-based modelling help to understand the dynamics behind urban economic segregation patterns through individual residential and economic behaviours and interactions in cities?

Residential mobility is well-modelled due to its relevance in wide range of social phenomena.

Economic mobility is less modelled, especially in spatial contexts.

ABMs of segregation primarily discussed location in segregation but not the complexity of residential choice or economic behaviour.

???

Earlier ABMs of segregation such as Schelling's segregation model, more focused on one particular mechanism. The location is still a component of segregation output, but less discussed the complexity of residential choice and economic mobility.

Rather small number of ABMs captured the residential mobility and economic mobility simultaneously in the same segregation model.

???

There were only few ABMs captured the residential mobility and economic mobility simultaneously in the same segregation model. Among these, a significant simplification of the residential choice and economic behaviour was made.

# Review

## The key actors

- **Household**

  Household is the most common actor modelled in related ABM.

???

In the former ABMs:

   - The household is a central and widely modelled actor.

   - It represents the basic unit of residential organization and decision-making.

---

# Review

## The key actors

- **Household**

  Household is the most common actor modelled in related ABM.
   
- **Individual**

  Individual, may called agent, is commonly modelled as the member of household. 
  
  Depending on the social phenomena and mechanism selected, the individual agent can be substituted by other actors. 

???

  - individuals are commonly modelled as members of households. Non-household individual agents are also modelled in some ABMs.

  Depending on the specific social phenomena and mechanisms, individual agents can take on various roles.
  
  For example, in rent market modelling, they can be tenants or houseowners. OR in job-oriented mobility modelling, they might be job-seekers or workers. 
  
  Generally, there are still individuals with different identities specified.

# Review

## The key actors

- **Household**

  Household is the most common actor modelled in related ABM.
    
- **Individual**

  Individual, may called agent, is commonly modelled as the member of household. 
  
  Depending on the social phenomena and mechanism selected, the individual agent can be substituted by other actors.

- **Other actors**
  
  The other actors, developer, urban sector or government, etc, are modelled as actor of interests in some ABMs which involves dynamic planning process. 

???

Additional actors such as developers, the urban sector, or government entities are introduced in some cases.

- These actors play distinct roles and are typically involved in dynamic planning processes.

- They are especially used as stakeholders of interests in examining policy interventions scenarios.

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_lifecourse_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Life Course Component**

The life course regulates the internal attributes of the agent, posing event and transition as a trigger of further responses on residential and economic mobility.

???

We can categorise the mechanism and process involved in the related ABMs into five key components.

The first one is the life course component.

It regulate the life transition of agents, posing them as a trigger of further responses on residential and economic mobility. It also alters ties between agents.

Especially for the ABM with long term simulation, life stage transition is increasingly being modelled, approached by early lifecycle model to a more dynamic life course model.

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_residentialmobility_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Residential Mobility Component**

The household make their residential decision, the residence location change can impact the social network change and the economic states.

???

The second one is the residential mobility component. It alters the location of actors, which can cause new relation ties or change of economic states by environmental exposure.

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_economicmobility_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Economic Mobility Component**

The economic states change can impact the residential decision.

???

The third one is the economic mobility component. 

It mainly triggers the residential motives by the economic states change, most referred as affordability.

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_socialnetwork_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Social Network Component**

Social networks serve as a foundational mechanism for capturing the complexities of social influence on behaviour.

???

These is also the social network component.

They allow researchers to explore how individual interactions and connections influence the micro residential and economic behaviours.

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_macroregulation_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Macro Level Regulation**

The macro level regulation was conceptualised  as the exogenous dynamics. It can impact the economic states and the residential decision. It imitates the role of policy interventions, and will be used to create the policy scenarios.
  
???

The last one is the macro level regulation component.

It was always coupled with other four components, and conceptualised as the exogenous dynamics. It imitates the role of policy interventions, and commonly be used to create the policy scenarios in the future.

# Review

## The knowledge base

For example, the opportunities

For example, the opportunities, which is the potential housing units, are well modelled in the former ABMs.

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/Gap_ResearchDesignStructure_50.svg)]

# Review

## Gap

For example, the tenure choice in residential mobility was widely researched theoretically, but rarely modelled together in ABM.

???

For example, tenure choice, theoretically, has substantial impact on housing security. Especially in the context of the Netherlands, the tenure choice is a key factor to explain the housing inequality. However, it is rarely modelled in ABM.

## Prototype Model design

### Case study

.image-40[![](../imgs/nl_casestudy_locationdes.jpg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. The case of Groningen and its population density.]]

The [Functional Urban Areas (FUA)<sup>a</sup>](https://www.oecd.org/cfe/regionaldevelopment/functional-urban-areas.htm) of Groningen.

The population of FUA of Groningen is <u>194, 340</u> in 2011 census, aggregated to around <u>80, 000</u> households.

.note[*Notes: <sup>a</sup>: each of FUA consists of a densely inhabited city and of a surrounding area (commuting zone)*]

???

To start the practice of ABM, I propose **Groningen** as the case study of this research. 

The reason is that it is more of a standalone city than a metropolitan region which is more suitable for the preliminary stage without too much external influence.

The population of the functional urban area of Groningen is one hundred ninety four thousand and three hundred forty. After being aggregated to household level, the total number of household will be around 80,000. The number is manageable and computable on a personal computer.

I intend this preliminary work to highlight the role of residential mobility across individuals' life course to economic segregation.

### The life course component

.right[![](../imgs/design/lifecoursemodel/example_life_course_001.svg)
.caption[.center[Figure. An example of life trajectory, events and impact on household characteristics.]]]

**Fundamental stages and essential micro life events**

The trajectories of individuals and households are intertwined with each other through the life events.

???

The basic component is the life course component.

- We've divided the life course into several fundamental stages and essential events. These stages and events are parametrised based on probability distributions that mirror historical trends. For example, we consider birth rates, marriage rates, and death rates when defining these events.

- The diagram shows an example trajectory of two people and the heterosexual household they formed. It's a snapshot of how our model brings together events and transitions that shape the individuals' and households' life courses.

- Although this example is linear, the transition in our model is not, it can go back and forth between stages depending on the events that occur.

### Residential mobility component

#### The residential utility

Residential Utility is defined by static attributes and dynamic preference varying over households.

???

Residential mobility is another important component we started to design.

Residential utility, in our research, is a combination of objective attributes and subjective judgements based on preferences. 

To make it more manageable, the subjective preference is based on economic, demographic, and social attributes of households.

### Residential mobility component

#### The residential utility

Residential Utility is defined by static attributes and dynamic preference varying over households.

The factors of perceived utility of housing include the accessibility to services, the living unit size fits the household size and the social group by income and demographic background<sup>a</sup>.

???

The diagram display some expectations from economic, demographic and social aspects. 

They are translated numerically into the weight of the preference for different residential attributes.

#### The housing decision process

<!-- preference, expectation, affordability, decision -->

Rules:

  The household will start the housing searching process if the utility of the current housing is lower than the expected utility.

???

The specific housing decision process is following certain rules, such as:

  The household will start the housing searching process if the utility of the current housing is lower than the expected utility.

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/housingsearchprocess/bidding_simplified.svg)]

#### The housing decision process

<!-- preference, expectation, affordability, decision -->

Rules:

  Household with higher disposable income on housing has <u>the priority</u> to select the housing units.

???

The household with higher disposable income on housing has the priority to select. Therefore, the household will not move if the affordability is lower than the expected cost of any of available housing units in their list.

### Entities (**change it more design related**)

.right[![](../imgs/design/entity-des/entities_individual_50.svg)]

#### Individuals

The individuals are the members of the household.

???

After setting up the structure, we can have an idea of the entities and their attributes.

The individuals are the members of the household.

--

Their attributes include the static attributes and dynamic attributes:

The dynamic choice attributes are the preference, tolerance and expectation, which are updated based on the experience of the household.

The dynamic state attributes are the current residence, current job, current income, current wealth, etc.

???

The dynamic choice attributes are the preference, tolerance and expectation, which are updated based on the experience of the household.

The dynamic state attributes are the current residence, current job, current income, current wealth, etc.

---

### Entities (**change it more design related**)

.right[![](../imgs/design/entity-des/entities_household_50.svg)]

#### Household

The individuals are the members of the household<sup>a</sup>, and the household is the minimum decision making unit of the model.

.note[*Notes: <sup>a</sup> The household covers the family and non-family household. The family household is the household with at least two members, and the non-family household is the household with one adult member.*]

???

Similar with household with various attributes and states. They are the major entities that make choices.

The attributes of entities was designed with extendability with other components (e.g., the marriage preference, tie, residence tenure type, etc.). Some of the attributes are fixed, while others are dynamic.

---

### Entities (**change it more design related**)

.right[![](../imgs/design/entity-des/entities_livingunit_50.svg)
]

#### Living Unit

The living units are the housing units in the grids of residence.

???

Living Units, one of the passive agents. These are the housing units.
---

### Entities (**change it more design related**)

.right[![](../imgs/design/entity-des/entities_spatialunit_50.svg)
]

#### Spatial Unit

The spatial units are the environment where the active agents live in. 

In our case, they are the grids of the city.

<!-- Entities introduction ends here -->

???

- Spatial Units are those are essentially the grids that make up our city.

We designed the attributes of these entities to incorporate more mechanisms for other future components such as marriage preferences, social ties, and residence tenure types.

## Limitations of the prototype model to be developed

### Error term (the overlooked factors and randomness)

The error term is not included in the prototype model yet.

### Decision rule

Some of rules are largely simplified, for example, the behaviour in housing market.

### The tolerance of the decision

At circumstances of certain events, such as job change or divorce, the tolerance of the residential decision will be increased.

### Absence of migration flow in and out of the system

The long-distance migration flow in and out of the system is not included in the prototype model. 

???

As we said, it is a prototype model, it haven't be programmed or test yet. But in term of design, there are several limitations we would make modifications soon:

Firstly, the absence of an error term in the model means that it fails to capture the influence of unaccounted factors and randomness. 

Additionally, the decision rules in the prototype are notably simplified, such as the housing market or searching radius, where more established theory driven rules are required. 

Furthermore, the model acknowledges that decisions are triggered by specific events like job changes or divorces, introducing a greater tolerance for final choice. 

Last but not the least is the absence of long-distance migration. When we upscale the case to region or national scale, the migration flow and diversity of commuting cannot be ignores.

---

## Overall challenges

### Diversity of individuals

  Without the diversity of individuals, the model might fail to capture endogenous dynamics of the main actors.

### The balance between the complexity and the simplicity of the model

  The more elements and the more detailed the behaviour and interaction rules, the larger the model needs to be and the longer the simulation will take.

### The interpretability of the model

  As the intercorrelation between different mechanisms, the impact of each mechanism is difficult to be isolated. 
  
  Sensitivity analysis and modelling them in building block will be the key to address this issue.

???

The overall challenges in developing the model also crucial:

First, the diversity of individuals is essential. Although, we select the most representative population group, but without the diversity of individuals, the model might fail to capture endogenous dynamics of the main actors.

There's a delicate balance to strike between model complexity and simplicity. Increasing the number of elements and detailed behaviour and interaction rules can lead to a larger and more time-consuming model. 

More seriously, the interpretability of the model poses a challenge due to the intercorrelation between different mechanisms, making it challenging to isolate the impact of each mechanism. 

To address this, sensitivity analysis and a modular approach to modelling are potential solutions.

# Evaluation

**What is the ideal ABM of urban economic segregation we are looking for?**

- A general decision making mindset

- A framework that simulated reliable micro behaviours

- A flexible and extendable framework

- A representative model of the target social phenomena with essential actors and mechanisms

???

So, what is the ABM of urban economic segregation we are looking for?

Exhibit a general decision-making mindset is essential to replicate it on other cities and larger scale.

Agents' behaviors should accurately represent the outcomes of mechanisms in the real world. What I mean here, it is not predictive accuracy, but the reliability of the mechanisms.

The model should be extensible for future enhancements and expansion.

And most importantly, the model should include the essential actors and mechanism that represents the target social phenomena.

A model meeting these criteria can provide insights into the complex dynamics of urban economic segregation.

Thank you!

---

#### Supplementary information for the project overview

##### Input data sources

- OECD report

- CBS Microdata

- Secondary survey data and former reports

##### Design concepts

- Basic principles

  Urban economic segregation is the collective outcome of individual's residential mobility and economic mobility behaviours over their life course.

- Emergence

  The spatial difference of economic status across residential neighbourhoods of a city or an urban region.

- Adaptation

  The active agent adjusts their preference, tolerance and expectation to their current condition and the environment.

---

##### Design concepts

- Fitness

  The goal of the household is to acquire the most suitable residence, based on their knowledge and cognitive skill, that fits their current demand and affordability.

- Learning

  The housing and relocation decision making is impacted by the experience of the household, such as the increasing relocation cost along with current location, residing years, tenure status, etc.

- Prediction

  The agents evaluate the utility of potential opportunities and the cost of their behaviours using environmental cues and embedded assumptions.

- Sensing

  What are agents assumed to know or perceive when making decisions?
  
  Is the sensing process itself explicitly modelled?

- Interaction

  The interactions include the form and decomposition of ties, the competition in the housing market, and the asset transfer through trading and inheritance.

---

##### Design concepts

- Stochasticity and uncertainty

  The heuristic rules are grounded in the empirical data, but the stochasticity is essential to keep the model simple and flexible.

  The parametrisation of rules and following variation of them in sensitivity analysis will be the key to understand the impact of each mechanism.

- Collectives

  The household is presented as a collective of individuals. It is being described in different way but the trait is intertwined with individual's life trajectory through the life course model.

- Observation

  A continuous time series of measurement on the uneven distribution of the household by income group and the economic status of the household.

  Other measurements depends on the calibration and validation process. For example, to validate the social network component, the evolution of social network of the household will be monitored.

Notes:

a: residential mobility: these, mostly, explain the inequality using the residential mobility and the social network from the residential perspective.

b: economic mobility: these, mostly, explain the inequality using the assets transfer and the social network from the economic perspective. Economic mobility is less modelled, especially under the spatial context. Still use the residential mobility to explain the economic mobility. Inheritance, social group impact especially in this field.

c: segregation: these, mostly, are extended from the Schelling's segregation model. It does not focus how the residential choice is made or how the economic status is changed. It usually focus on only one mechanism. Although location choice is included as intermedia variable, it is hardly to be used to explain the segregation.

d: residential mobility and economic mobility: these talked about the residential mobility and economic mobility in the same model, but simulate other social phenomena.

e: residential mobility and segregation: these, mostly, explain the inequality using the residential mobility and the social network from the residential perspective.

f: economic and segregation: these, mostly, explain the inequality using the assets transfer and the social network from the economic perspective.

g: residential mobility, economic mobility and segregation: these, mostly, explain the inequality using the residential mobility and the social network from the residential perspective.
