## Agent-Based Modelling 

ABM is a bottom-up approach to modelling, simulating collective social phenomena from micro behaviors.

- ABM is a bottom-up approach to modelling.

- It aims to understand complex social phenomena by simulating individual behaviours.

## Agent-Based Modelling 

ABM is a bottom-up approach to modelling, simulating collective social phenomena from micro behaviors.

### Entities

In ABM, there are typically two layers of entities: the actor layer and the environment layer:

- Actors

  The human actors, <u>active agents</u>, can move around and interact with other entities. 

- Environment

  The environment, <u>passive agents</u>, is where the active agents reside.

???

So in ABM, entities refer to the actors and the environment.

- Active agents, often represented as human actors, capable of moving around and interacting with each other.

- Passive agents represent the environment in which the human actors reside and act.

---

<!-- About Agent-Based Modelling: Rules and interactions -->

.right[.image-90[![](../imgs/whatisABM/whatisABM_envimpact.svg)]]

## Agent-Based Modelling

### Rules

- The rules guides how the agents behave and interact with each other.

- These rules are based on both dynamic and static attributes.

### Interactions

- Actors interact with each other and the environment, altering their states.

- The interactions can vary over time and space.

???

Another key component of ABM is the rules.

- Rule-based ABM is the most common approach, where rules govern behaviours and interaction. 

- These rules could be based on both dynamic attributes (such as the agent's own states or social ties) and static attributes (such as social norms).

Rules guide interactions.

- And interactions lead to changes in the state of other agents and environment.

- The interactions can be dynamic, varying over time and space, in response to changing circumstances.

.right[.image-90[![](../imgs/whatisABM/whatisABM_outcomes.svg)]]

## Agent-Based Modelling 

### Emergent Phenomena

- The actors' and environment's changing states indicate <u>social and environmental impacts</u> on the system.

- The social and environmental impacts contribute to <u>the phenomena of the system</u> collectively.

???

The social and environmental impacts can be observed through the changing states of the actors and the environment.

These social and environmental impacts, collectively, contribute to the emergence of certain phenomena or pattern. 

In our case, it is the urban economic segregation.

### Emergent Phenomena

- The actors' and environment's changing states indicate <u>social and environmental impacts</u> on the system.

- The social and environmental impacts contribute to <u>the phenomena of the system</u> collectively.

In form of **urban economic segregation**:

- What are the key entities?

- What are the key behaviour rules?

???

Going back to the basics, we can ask ourselves:

In the evolution of urban economic segregation:

- What are the key entities?

- What are the key behaviour rules?

<!-- The overview of the ABM's theoretical framework -->

# Overview

## The target social phenomena

**Urban economic segregation**

> The uneven distribution of groups with **different economic status** across **residential neighbourhoods** of a city or an urban region (adapted from Van Ham et al. (2021)).

???

But first, we interpret this term as the spatial differences of groups with different economic status across neighbourhoods. 

It indicates two essential aspects: location and economic status.

---

# Overview

## The target social phenomena

**Urban economic segregation**

> The uneven distribution of groups with **different economic status** across **residential neighbourhoods** of a city or an urban region (adapted from Van Ham et al. (2021)).

Two fundamental questions:

- Why do people choose to live where they live?

- How the their economic status change over time?

???

Therefore, we aim to address two fundamental questions:

- "Why do people live where they live?"
  
  This question addresses the factor of residential choices.

- And "How does an individual's economic status change over time?" 

  This question pertains to the dynamics of economic mobility.

Two fundamental questions:

- Why do people choose to live where they live?

- How the their economic status change over time?

### Research question

How can agent-based modelling enhance our understanding of the <u>dynamics driving urban economic segregation patterns</u> through the study of **individual residential and economic behaviors and interactions** in cities?

???

Then, we form our research question as:

How can agent-based modelling help the understanding of the dynamics behind urban economic segregation patterns through individual residential and economic behaviors and interactions in cities?

.right[![](../imgs/design/theoreticalframework.svg)
.caption[.center[Theoretical framework from micro behaviours <br>to social phenomena through ABM]]]

# Overview

???

From the framework, the micro social simulation at large scale connects the housing decision, economic behaviours and the residential and economic states changes, leading to the emerged pattern of economic segregation.

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/theoreticalframework.svg)
.caption[.center[Theoretical framework from micro behaviours <br>to social phenomena through ABM]]]

# Overview

## Purpose

- To create a versatile and adaptable ABM framework
  
- To model the intricate interplay of residential and economic behaviors

- To provide simulated evidence for policymakers.

???

Our purpose is threefold: 

- To build an ABM on <u>a general, flexible and extendable framework</u> in forming urban economic segregation.

- To simulate <u>the interplay of residential and economic behaviours over individual's life course</u>.

- and to provide <u>simulated evidence from scenarios modelling of policy interventions</u> for policy makers.

# Review

.right[![](../imgs/slr/slr_classificationclusters.svg)
.caption[.center[Collection of the related ABMs from the literature]]]

- ABMs of residential mobility are well developed, but the economic mobility is less modelled.

- Rather small number of ABMs (N = 5) captured the residential mobility and economic mobility simultaneously in the same segregation model.

- Segregation

???

Notes:

a: residential mobility: these, mostly, explain the inequality using the residential mobility and the social network from the residential perspective.

b: economic mobility: these, mostly, explain the inequality using the assets transfer and the social network from the economic perspective.

c: segregation: these, mostly, are extended from the Schelling's segregation model. It does not focus how the residential choice is made or how the economic status is changed. It usually focus on only one mechanism. Although location choice is included as intermedia variable, it is hardly to be used to explain the segregation.

d: residential mobility and economic mobility: these talked about the residential mobility and economic mobility in the same model, but simulate other social phenomena.

e: residential mobility and segregation: these, mostly, explain the inequality using the residential mobility and the social network from the residential perspective.

f: economic and segregation: these, mostly, explain the inequality using the assets transfer and the social network from the economic perspective.

g: residential mobility, economic mobility and segregation: these, mostly, explain the inequality using the residential mobility and the social network from the residential perspective.

## The key actors

- **Household**

  Household is the most common actor modelled in related ABM.

???

In the former ABMs:

   - The household is a central and widely modelled actor.

   - It represents the basic unit of residential organization and decision-making.

---

# Review

## The key actors

- **Household**

  Household is the most common actor modelled in related ABM.
   
- **Individual**

  Individual, may called agent, is commonly modelled as the member of household. 
  
  Depending on the social phenomena and mechanism selected, the individual agent can be substituted by other actors. 

???

  - individuals are commonly modelled as members of households. Non-household individual agents are also modelled in some ABMs.

  Depending on the specific social phenomena and mechanisms, individual agents can take on various roles. for example:
    
    - For modelling wealth growth, they may become individual economic entities.
    
    - In rent market modelling, they can be tenants or houseowners.
    
    - In job-oriented mobility modelling, they might be job-seekers or workers.

  Depending on the social phenomena and mechanism selected, the individual agent can be substituted by other actors.

- **Other actors**
  
  The other actors, developer, urban sector or government, etc, are modelled as actor of interests in some ABMs which involves dynamic planning process. 

???

In some ABMs, additional actors such as developers, the urban sector, or government entities are introduced.

- These actors play distinct roles and are typically involved in dynamic planning processes.

- They are especially used as stakeholders of interests in examining policy interventions or urban development scenarios.

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_lifecourse_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Life Course Component**

The life course regulates the internal attributes of the agent, posing event and transition as a trigger of further responses on residential and economic mobility.

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_residentialmobility_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Residential Mobility Component**

The household make their residential decision, the residence location change can impact the social network change and the economic states.

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_economicmobility_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Economic Mobility Component**

The economic states change can impact the residential decision.

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_socialnetwork_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Social Network Component**

The social network is the key mechanism to model the social influence and the social capital.

The social network can impact the residential decision through social impact.  

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/component_design/components_macroregulation_80.svg)]

## The key components

**Macro Level Regulation**

The macro level regulation was conceptualised  as the exogenous dynamics. It can impact the economic states and the residential decision. It imitates the role of policy interventions, and will be used to create the policy scenarios in the future.
  
???

From the literature, we identify five key components of the related decision making.
  
- **Life transition**

  Life course is widely used for modelling long term social phenomena like migration, urban decay<sup>18, 19</sup>. Especially for the ABM with long term simulation, life stage transition is increasingly being modelled in ABMs of residential mobility, approached by early lifecycle model <sup>1, 15, 17</sup> to the more dynamic life course model <sup>2, 12</sup>.

  The key event being modelling in life transitions, including birth and death, marriage and divorce, being independent etc.<sup>1, 2, 12, 17, 19, 20, 21</sup>

- **Residential mobility**

  As we use both economic and residential mobility to search for the literature, the ABM focus on economic mobility 

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/Combine_Process_granularFramework_50.svg)]

# Review

## Mechanisms and processes

Among the potential mechanisms and processes, some are well modelled before (green box), and some are not widely included (red box).

???

The migration is widely modelled, but the migration were not distinguished with residential mobility. The drive of migration was always modelled as attractiveness of uneven development but no further, where the migration is more modelled as input than output.

Overall, aside from the housing market behaviours, the mechanism within economic mobility is less modelled within spatial context.

# Review

## Gap and Potential

(example of certain mechanism of well modelled and overlooked.)

Land use policy often modelled as land use supply, but some of them included the other actors (e.g., developer, government) to model the dynamic planning process.

Life course processes were mostly modelled as the early lifecycle model with probability-based transition, but the dynamic life course model is increasingly being modelled.

.note[*Notes: Commuting behaviours were connected to residential choice, but it lays on more transport research particularly*]

## Prototype Model design

### Case study

.image-40[![](../imgs/nl_casestudy_locationdes.jpg)]
.caption[.center[Figure. The case of Groningen and its population density.]]

The [Functional Urban Areas (FUA)<sup>a</sup>](https://www.oecd.org/cfe/regionaldevelopment/functional-urban-areas.htm) of Groningen.

The population of FUA of Groningen is <u>194, 340</u> in 2011 census, aggregated to around <u>80, 000</u> households.

.note[*Notes: <sup>a</sup>: each of FUA consists of a densely inhabited city and of a surrounding area (commuting zone)*]

???

I propose **Groningen** as the case study of this research. 

The reason is that it is more of a standalone city than a metropolitan region which is more suitable for the preliminary stage without too much external influence. Even consider the out-of-system migration flow, it is easier to measure and parametrise from the historical data.

developed by OECD and the European Commission, 

The population of FUA of Groningen is around two hundred thousand. After being aggregated to household level, the total number of household will be around 80,000. The number is computable on a personal computer.

I intend this preliminary work to highlight the role of residential mobility across individuals' life course to economic segregation.

<!-- The life course component -->

### The life course component

.right[![](../imgs/design/lifecoursemodel/example_life_course_001.svg)
.caption[.center[Figure. An example of life trajectory, events and impact on household characteristics.]]]

**Fundamental stages and essential micro life events**

The trajectories of individuals and households are intertwined with each other through the life events.

???

The basic component is the life course component. Our goal with it is to capture the key milestones and transitions that were validated in former studies. 

- We've divided the life course into several fundamental stages and essential events. These stages and events are parametrised based on probability distributions that mirror historical trends. For example, we consider birth rates, marriage rates, and death rates when defining these events.

- Some of these events follow a specific sequence or schedule. For instance, you have to have a partner to break up, or you have to have a job to be fired or retire, ect.

- This diagram shows an example life trajectory of two people and the household they formed, highlighting various events and their impact on household characteristics. It's a snapshot of how our model brings together events and transitions that shape the individuals' and households' life courses.

- Most of them will be parametrised based on probability distribution mirroring the empirical data (e.g., birth rate, marriage rate, death rate); 

- some of them follows a certain sequence or schedule (e.g., Birth -> being independent).

### The life course component

.right[![](../imgs/design/lifecoursemodel/example_life_course_002.svg)
.caption[.center[Figure. An example of life trajectory, events and impact on household characteristics.]]]

**Fundamental stages and essential micro life events**

Life events have the potential to trigger relocation desires, influence preferences for residence and economic states.

???

This diagram shows the essential life stages and life events that households and individuals experience and how they impact house size requirement, preferences and disposable income on housing, that is affordability.
As a note, the life events included in life course component is micro life events. While macro events such as economic crises, pandemics, and wars exist in the real world, we've excluded them to concentrate on more consistent long-term macro regulators like interest rates, immigration numbers, and employment rates, which we'll address separately in the macro-level regulation component.
It can be categorized into two main types: individual events and family events. They can occur within individual or household life trajectories, served as triggers for subsequent responses in terms of residential and economic mobility.

<!-- Residential mobility component -->

.right[![](../imgs/design/utility_preference/preferencebasedutilitycalculation.svg)]

### Residential mobility component

#### The residential utility

Residential Utility is defined by static attributes and the preference for different residential options based on various economic, demographic, and social attributes of households.

--


The preference is simplified to impact perceived utility of housing, which is based on the accessibility to services, the living unit size fits the household size and the social group by income and demographic background<sup>a</sup>.

.note[*Notes: <sup>a</sup>: The preference level of residing with similar economic and demographic neighbours.*]

???

Residential utility, in our research, is a combination of objective attributes and subjective judgements based on preferences. To make it more manageable, the subjective preference for different residential options based on economic, demographic, and social attributes of households.

- The diagram display some expectations from economic, demographic and social aspects. They impact the weight of the preference for different residential attributes.

- As a note, the preference level for residing with similar economic and demographic neighbors is a crucial aspect. It is common to simplify it as a global parameter, allowing us to create different scenarios.

.right[![](../imgs/design/housingsearchprocess/utility_comparison.svg)]

#### The housing decision process

<!-- preference, expectation, affordability, decision -->

Rules:

  The household will start the housing searching process if the utility of the current housing is lower than the expected utility.

---

.right[![](../imgs/design/housingsearchprocess/bidding_simplified.svg)]

#### The housing decision process

<!-- preference, expectation, affordability, decision -->

Rules:

  Household with higher disposable income on housing has <u>the priority</u> to select the housing units. Therefore, the household will not move if <u>the affordability is lower than the expected cost</u> of any of available housing units in list.

<!-- Entities introduction starts here -->

### Entities (**change it more design related**)

.right[![](../imgs/design/entity-des/entities_individual_50.svg)]

#### Individuals

The individuals are the members of the household<sup>a</sup>.

Their attributes include the static attributes and dynamic attributes. 

--

The dynamic choice attributes are the preference, tolerance and expectation, which are updated based on the experience of the household. 

--

The dynamic state attributes are the current residence, current job, current income, current wealth, etc.

???

Active agents, including the **individuals and household**, are the key actors of the model. 

The attributes of entities was designed with extendability with other components (e.g., the marriage preference, tie, residence tenure type, etc.). Some of the attributes are fixed, while others are dynamic.

There are two types of agents in the model: active agents and passive agents.

Active agents consist of individuals and households. Let's break this down further:

- Individuals: These are the people who make up the households.

- Households: Think of households as the decision-making units. They are the major entities that make choices.

  Small notes on that one adult was seen as an one-person household in our model, this is also consistent with the definition of the CBS household summary.

Passive agents include spatial units and living units:

- Spatial Units are those are essentially the grids that make up our city. They form the backdrop where our active agents interact.

- Living Units: These are the housing units within the spatial unit of residence. They provide the physical spaces where our active agents reside.

We designed the attributes of these entities to incorporate more mechanisms for other future components such as marriage preferences, social ties, and residence tenure types.

Among these attributes, some attributes are fixed, while others change dynamically as the model runs.

---

### Entities (**change it more design related**)

.right[![](../imgs/design/entity-des/entities_household_50.svg)]

#### Household

The individuals are the members of the household<sup>a</sup>, and the household is the minimum decision making unit of the model.

.note[*Notes: <sup>a</sup> The household covers the family and non-family household. The family household is the household with at least two members, and the non-family household is the household with one adult member.*]

???

There are two types of agents in the model: active agents and passive agents.

Active agents consist of individuals and households. Let's break this down further:

## Limitations of the prototype model to be developed

### Error term (the uncaptured factors and randomness)

The error term is not included in the prototype model yet.

### Decision rule

Some of rules are largely simplified, for example, the behaviour in housing market.

### The tolerance of the decision

At circumstances of certain events, such as job change or divorce, the tolerance of the residential decision will be increased.

### Absence of migration flow in and out of the system

The long-distance migration flow in and out of the system is not included in the prototype model. 

???

The prototype model has several limitations. 

Firstly, the absence of an error term in the model means that it fails to capture the influence of unaccounted factors and randomness. 

Additionally, the decision rules in the prototype are notably simplified, particularly in contexts such as the housing market, where more established economic theory driven rules are required. 


Furthermore, the model acknowledges that certain decisions to relocate are triggered by specific events like job changes or divorces, introducing a greater tolerance for final choice. 

In terms of data quality, the prototype faces issues related to inconsistencies and measurement errors, which could be addressed through the application of micro data or, in the absence of reliable data, distribution based on empirical data. 

Perhaps one of the most prominent limitations is the absence of long-distance migration. Future iterations may need to consider incorporating alternative decision-making models, like expected utility models under risk, to provide a more robust theoretical basis.

At the phase, the searching radius is fixed to their current residence for simplification reason, the following works could introduce <u>trigger-oriented searching radius</u> (e.g., job-oriented, education-oriented) and <u>social impacted searching radius</u> (e.g., proximity to relatives and current network).

---

## Overall challenges

### Diversity of individuals

  Without the diversity of individuals, the model might fail to capture endogenous dynamics of the main actors.

### The balance between the complexity and the simplicity of the model

  The more elements and the more detailed the behaviour and interaction rules, the larger the model needs to be and the longer the simulation will take.

### The interpretability of the model

  As the intercorrelation between different mechanisms, the impact of each mechanism is difficult to be isolated. 
  
  Sensitivity analysis and modelling them in building block will be the key to address this issue.

???

The overall challenges in developing the model also crucial: 

First, there's a delicate balance to strike between model complexity and simplicity. Increasing the number of elements and detailed behavior and interaction rules can lead to a larger and more time-consuming model. 

More seriously, the interpretability of the model poses a challenge due to the intercorrelation between different mechanisms, making it challenging to isolate the impact of each mechanism. To address this, sensitivity analysis and a modular approach to modelling are potential solutions.

Thank you!

---

#### Supplementary information for the project overview

##### Input data sources

- OECD report

- CBS Microdata

- Secondary survey data and former reports

##### Design concepts

- Basic principles

  Urban economic segregation is the collective outcome of individual's residential mobility and economic mobility behaviours over their life course.

- Emergence

  The spatial difference of economic status across residential neighbourhoods of a city or an urban region.

- Adaptation

  The active agent adjusts their preference, tolerance and expectation to their current condition and the environment.

---

##### Design concepts

- Fitness

  The goal of the household is to acquire the most suitable residence, based on their knowledge and cognitive skill, that fits their current demand and affordability.

- Learning

  The housing and relocation decision making is impacted by the experience of the household, such as the increasing relocation cost along with current location, residing years, tenure status, etc.

- Prediction

  The agents evaluate the utility of potential opportunities and the cost of their behaviours using environmental cues and embedded assumptions.

- Sensing

  What are agents assumed to know or perceive when making decisions?
  
  Is the sensing process itself explicitly modelled?

- Interaction

  The interactions include the form and decomposition of ties, the competition in the housing market, and the asset transfer through trading and inheritance.

---

##### Design concepts

- Stochasticity and uncertainty

  The heuristic rules are grounded in the empirical data, but the stochasticity is essential to keep the model simple and flexible.

  The parametrisation of rules and following variation of them in sensitivity analysis will be the key to understand the impact of each mechanism.

- Collectives

  The household is presented as a collective of individuals. It is being described in different way but the trait is intertwined with individual's life trajectory through the life course model.

- Observation

  A continuous time series of measurement on the uneven distribution of the household by income group and the economic status of the household.

  Other measurements depends on the calibration and validation process. For example, to validate the social network component, the evolution of social network of the household will be monitored.
